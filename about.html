she's not stopping bad guys' with her inspiring

to bring this site alive.

                                    Health-geek, blogger, TEDx speaker,entrepreneur, 
and Gudetama Father, Jacob wears many hats 
(except the ones in real life). He is especially
known for his out-of-this-world ability
to describe things and tell stories. They
really just blow people away.. probably
because they don't make sense half the time.
He's also the one writing this bio, so if
the above made no sense, hi there! Ok, enough 
gibber jabber - Jacob enjoys spending time
building websites and of course has felt
absolutely blessed to host season 1 of 
Gudetama Travels.

                                    Amy Niu. The one most likely to quiz your 
emotional intelligence before deciding to
be your friend. Just kidding! Unless...
Whatever the case, Jacob and Emily are 
grateful they passed the test to have the pleasure
of being her friends and getting to
building this site with her. She's a real
go-getter with a passion for coding, deep-convos,
and fighting-stances (see Jacob to the left).
Wondering why Gudetama might be giving you 
sass when you ask him a question.. you can thank
Amy for that ~AI~. On the topic of curiousity, ya'll should take a look
at Amy's github, she's building quite
the portfolio.
